What I'm not currently not interested in doing:
- renting GPUs
- training my own models
- collecting and cleaning training data
- trying to create data pipelines
- spending hours trying to build something, and not using the built thing
- doing the work of a data engineer

I'm more interested in the below.


## The concepts behind the models

- [ ] Watch [Why Neural Networks can learn (almost) anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QczhVg5HaI)
- [ ] Watch [But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)
- [ ] Watch [From RNNs to GPT 4 - 10 years of NLP research explained in 50 concepts | Neural Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uocYQH0cWTs)
- [ ] Watch [How ChatGPT Works Technically | ChatGPT Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSvTVREwSNw)
- [ ] Watch [A Taxonomy of the Neural Network Zoo - Stefan Leijnan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkoFmLwkKU)
- [ ] Watch [Neural Network Architectures & Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJNHXPs0XDk)


## Where things in the field are going

- [ ] Watch [CHATGPT + WOLFRAM - THE FUTURE OF AI!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5WZhCBRDpU)
- [ ] Watch [Sparks of AGI: early experiments with GPT-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIk7-JPB2c)

## How can I be a better <u>user</u> of AI, as opposed to how to become a creator or maintainer of AI systems

- [ ] Try using prompts from `:ChatGPTActAs`


## What are expected near future business applications of machine learning models?
