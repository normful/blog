# Kanji Study (Android App)

Download Kanji Study from the Google Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindtwisted.kanjistudy).

I use this app to look up new words in virtually all situations where I need to look up Japanese words, including when reading books, watching TV, speaking with Japanese people in real life, etc.

The app might be only suitable for Japanese learners who are at upper elementary levels or higher (JLPT N4 or higher). I found the information in this app to be too advanced when I was a total beginner of Japanese.

Unforunately this app only exists on Android. I believe this app is the very best app for serious study of Japanese, and is far superior than all other Android apps and iOS apps in this category. Other apps don't even come close in terms of the amount of information and the features of the app. So if you're a diehard iPhone can, perhaps you could consider getting another inexpensive used Android device to use this app.

## As a dictionary

You can use Kanji Study like a dictionary. In many ways, it's better than many dictionaries because of the app generates internal links to all of the other kanji, vocabulary, and example sentences.

Under your Android Widgets, you can add the Kanji Search widget to your home screen. This widget allows you to launch the dictionary look up screen with 1 tap.

## Kanji explanations

Purchasing the Outlier Kanji Dictionary add-on will add additional detailed kanji explanations to each kanji page. I've found the explanations to be crucial for understanding some of the history behind particular kanji radicals, which has made learning new kanji easier.

## Kanji writing quizzes

I find kanji easier to remember after I've developed some muscle memory from writing them with my fingers.

The Kanji Study app allows you to quiz yourself on the writing of kanji, including checking that you're writing with the correct stroke order.

## Reading exercises

With the Kanji Learner's Course Graded Reading Sets add-on, all kanji and vocabulary pages in the app will display natural curated example sentences. All words in all example sentences can be looked up too.
