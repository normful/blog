I currently continue to study Japanese for several specific goals, in rough
descending priority:

1. Know what I'm buying at the grocery store (see [Japanese packaged food labels I want to read entirely](@/blog/Japanese%20packaged%20food%20labels%20I%20want%20to%20read%20entirely.md))
2. Be able to visualize ingredients when reading a menu
3. Understand what I'm supposed to do, without being told (reading public signs and notices)
4. Read road signs rapidly
