I use these two Anki apps:
- [Anki for macOS](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
- [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) on Android

# Adding new words on my phone

With the Kanji Study app installed on my Android phone, I can quickly create new Anki Notes for new words or example sentences with just a few taps.

See [my post about Anki](@/blog/kanji-study/index.md#As_a_rapid_Anki_note_creator) for more details.
