Anki is a spaced repetition software (SRS) for learning and reviewing content over a long period of time. I use it for reviewing new Japanese words and sentences that I encounter.

I use these two Anki apps:
- [Anki for macOS](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
- [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) on Android

# Why you should or shouldn't use Anki

As a beginner, I don't think it's necessary to use Anki. It might be overkill, because you probably don't need the ability to customize what words you learn. You don't know nearly any Japanese words, so you should just learn whatever basic words are introduced to you.

# Why intermediate learners should create their own word lists (Anki decks)

At the intermediate level of Japanese, the specificity of words starts to become important. There are broad general Anki decks that other people have created such as [this](https://cotoacademy.com/japanese-anki-decks-to-learn-japanese/).

But I find it inefficient to study general decks because:
1. They include many words I already know.
2. They lack the specific words that I don't know and want to know or need to know.
3. The notes created in these general decks lack the specific context where I encountered a particular word.

By creating my own Anki deck, I reduce the amount of time I need to review the words, and I can create exactly what I need. I end up spending less time reviewing, reviewing exactly what I need, and ultimately having more fun.

# Adding new words on my laptop

With Yomichan installed, adding a card for a word seen while browsing a website can be done with just one keyboard shortcut.

The added card looks like this in the note browser.

See [my Yomichan post](@/blog/yomichan/index.md) for details about how I configure Yomichan.

I prefer to add cards on my laptop using this approach because Yomichan can save the surrounding context in the new note as well.

# Adding new words/sentences on my phone

With the Kanji Study app installed on my Android phone, I can quickly create new Anki notes for new words or example sentences with just a few taps.

See [my post about Anki](@/blog/kanji-study/index.md#As_a_rapid_Anki_note_creator) for more details.

When viewing a created note in the AnkiDroid note browser, it looks like this:

The only downside about these word cards is that they lack any kind of context.

So you may also find it helpful to also create sentence-based notes from sentences in Kanji Study.

# Studying previously saved words/sentences

I study cards in both **Anki for macOS** and **AnkiDroid**.

When studying cards created by Kanji Study, they look like this:

When studying cards created by Yomichan, they look like this:

# Manually adding new words/sentences to Anki manually

Several articles and videos online suggest creating new Anki notes manually. I think that's a large waste of time that could be better spent doing other things.

Instead, I always add new notes using one of the two mostly automatic methods above.
