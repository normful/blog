I use these two Anki apps:
- [Anki for macOS](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
- [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) on Android

# Adding new words/sentences on my phone

With the Kanji Study app installed on my Android phone, I can quickly create new Anki notes for new words or example sentences with just a few taps.

See [my post about Anki](@/blog/kanji-study/index.md#As_a_rapid_Anki_note_creator) for more details.

When viewing a created note in the AnkiDroid note browser, it looks like this:

# Adding new words on my laptop

With Yomichan installed, adding a card for a word seen while browsing a website can be done with just one keyboard shortcut.

The added card looks like this in the note browser.

See [my Yomichan post](@/blog/yomichan/index.md) for details about how I configure Yomichan.

# Studying previously saved words/sentences

I study cards in both **Anki for macOS** and **AnkiDroid**.

When studying cards created by Kanji Study, they look like this:

When studying cards created by Yomichan, they look like this:

# Manually adding new words/sentences to Anki manually

Several articles and videos online suggest creating new Anki notes manually. I think that's a large waste of time that could be better spent doing other things.

Instead, I always add new notes using one of the two mostly automatic methods above.
